It is necessary to suspend disbelief on several occasions, but overall the film succeeds as entertainment. Having the kid along seemed like kind of a stretch as well.

The film is incredibly bizarre and quite bloody, and while it isn&apos;t a must-see it is warmly recommended to fans of cult-cinema and weird stuff.\\n\\nWhile playing with his son, Sam Phillips (Philip Sayer) is abducted by an alien force. Several years thereafter he returns (in a somewhat bizarre manner), and isn&apos;t quite the same anymore... This may not really be a proper plot description of &quot;Xtro&quot;, but the film really is way too bizarre in order to properly describe it without spoiling it. &quot;Xtro&quot; is weird from start to finish, and that is exactly what makes it interesting. &quot;Xtro&quot; has an undeniable Trash-feeling, which also only makes it more valuable for my fellow cult-cinema fans. The film landed on the Video Nasty list due to its gore. The gory scenes are intense and includes one particularly nauseating &apos;birth&apos;-sequence. &quot;Xtro&quot; is still probably one of the less explicit films on this list, which generally shows that film-censors lack both intelligence and art-appreciation. The storyline actually quite interesting, though sometimes a bit too confused. It gets quite goofy at times, but then it has its genuinely ingenious moments.\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning that this is the first film featuring the sexy Maryam d&apos;Abo, who is best known for her Bondgirl role in &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987). She plays a French au-pair-girl here. The performances are generally pretty good, especially for a film that has seems somewhat trashy and cheap. The gore- and make-up effects vary between brutally nauseating and cheesy, depending on the particular sequence. Overall, &quot;Xtro&quot; is recommendable to my fellow fans of bizarre Horror, though I wouldn&apos;t say you&apos;ve missed a lot if you decide to skip it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8425,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1983-01-07","keywords":"nudity,female frontal nudity,female full frontal nudity,female nudity,evil wins","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0768455/","name":"Philip Sayer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0825231/","name":"Bernice Stegers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0104060/","name":"Danny Brainin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0111332/","name":"Harry Bromley Davenport"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0016458/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0111332/","name":"Harry Bromley Davenport"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0144262/","name":"Iain Cassie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003176/","name":"Michel Parry"}],"duration":"PT1H24M"}]', 'url': 'https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086610/', 'name': 'Xtro'}}, {'id': 2425427447374143964, 'distance': 0.41570377349853516, 'entity': {'text': '[{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/","name":"The Thing","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA3NDU5MWEtNTk4Yy00ZDNkLThmZTQtMjU3ZGVhYzAyMzU4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg","description":"A research team in Antarctica is hunted by a shape-shifting alien that assumes the appearance of its victims.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Movie","url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"mcseph"},"dateCreated":"2001-09-29","inLanguage":"English","name":"Finally getting recognition.","reviewBody":"I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this film was only about a year ago.  After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and bought the DVD collectors&apos; edition and have watched it many times since.\\n\\nThe film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look into the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear, lent not only by Carpenter&apos;s direction (which is stunning) but also by the incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct result he &quot;feels&quot; like a real person, rather than a hollywood &quot;all american hero&quot;.  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and the net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":485829,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1982-06-25","keywords":"isolation,antarctica,paranoia,alien creature,shapeshifting","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Thing","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2298151193","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzBhZmNmYzgtMmZkMC00ODYxLWJiYjctOGFkOTYwMWZhZDk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzBhZmNmYzgtMmZkMC00ODYxLWJiYjctOGFkOTYwMWZhZDk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2298151193/","description":"Scientists in the Antarctic are confronted by a shape-shifting alien that assumes the appearance of the people that it kills.","duration":"PT1M54S","uploadDate":"2008-04-11T17:15:47Z"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000621/","name":"Kurt Russell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000979/","name":"Wilford Brimley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0202966/","name":"Keith David"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000118/","name":"John Carpenter"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0004522/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0220554/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0484111/","name":"Bill Lancaster"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0132168/","name":"John W.
