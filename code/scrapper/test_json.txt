The film is incredibly bizarre and quite bloody, and while it isn&apos;t a must-see it is warmly recommended to fans of cult-cinema and weird stuff.\n\nWhile playing with his son, Sam Phillips (Philip Sayer) is abducted by an alien force. Several years thereafter he returns (in a somewhat bizarre manner), and isn&apos;t quite the same anymore... This may not really be a proper plot description of &quot;Xtro&quot;, but the film really is way too bizarre in order to properly describe it without spoiling it. &quot;Xtro&quot; is weird from start to finish, and that is exactly what makes it interesting. &quot;Xtro&quot; has an undeniable Trash-feeling, which also only makes it more valuable for my fellow cult-cinema fans. The film landed on the Video Nasty list due to its gore. The gory scenes are intense and includes one particularly nauseating &apos;birth&apos;-sequence. &quot;Xtro&quot; is still probably one of the less explicit films on this list, which generally shows that film-censors lack both intelligence and art-appreciation. The storyline actually quite interesting, though sometimes a bit too confused. It gets quite goofy at times, but then it has its genuinely ingenious moments.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that this is the first film featuring the sexy Maryam d&apos;Abo, who is best known for her Bondgirl role in &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987). She plays a French au-pair-girl here. The performances are generally pretty good, especially for a film that has seems somewhat trashy and cheap. The gore- and make-up effects vary between brutally nauseating and cheesy, depending on the particular sequence. Overall, &quot;Xtro&quot; is recommendable to my fellow fans of bizarre Horror, though I wouldn&apos;t say you&apos;ve missed a lot if you decide to skip it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8425,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1983-01-07","keywords":"nudity,female frontal nudity,female full frontal nudity,female nudity,evil wins","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0768455/","name":"Philip Sayer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0825231/","name":"Bernice Stegers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0104060/","name":"Danny Brainin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0111332/","name":"Harry Bromley Davenport"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0016458/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0111332/","name":"Harry Bromley Davenport"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0144262/","name":"Iain Cassie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003176/","name":"Michel Parry"}],"duration":"PT1H24M"}]

It is very hard to find and was probably never released in the USA but there are English subtitles available. It is a slice of life of a Prague family living during Soviet control times. The young boy is literally a hostage since his parents escaped to Austria and the government will not let him join them without papers. The boy stays with grandparents and much of the film is from the boy&apos;s perspective. The IMDB summary describes the film succinctly. It is a very touching film and reminds us of our childhood no matter where we were brought up. In that way it is reminiscent of Stephen King&apos;s Stand By Me. The grandfather is one that everyone would love to have. I can&apos;t recommend this film enough if you can find it. I think Amazon has it, at least they did because that&apos;s how it came to my attention. Can&apos;t believe this didn&apos;t get an Oscar nomination although the Academy may only consider films released in the US.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"genre":["Comedy","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2014-12-04","keywords":"czechoslovakia,cold war era,christmas,grandfather grandson relationship,grandmother grandson relationship","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5971154/","name":"Richard Labuda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0489583/","name":"Milan Lasica"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0755941/","name":"Libuse Safr\u00e1nkov\u00e1"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0638434/","name":"Juraj Nvota"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0033780/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0685546/","name":"Peter Pistanek"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0881636/","name":"Marian Urban"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}]

But after watching this one, I kind of wish they&apos;d have left the series dead and buried. \n\nThe plot is about an eighteen year old teenager Will (Landon Liboiron) who is beginning to turn into a werewolf all while vying for the love of his classmate Eliana (Lindsey Shaw). Together the two have to try and stop other werewolves from killing them or something, blah, blah, blah. It is just so ridiculous, there&apos;s really no need to go further about the &quot;plot&quot;. While I was watching this, all I could think of was that this was a cheap rip off of the Twilight series. Now I have nothing against Twilight, I haven&apos;t seen it personally. But to fans of the original films, this was a kick in the gut. Sure some of the sequels made after the first Howling were pretty awful, but this one is catering to a different audience than the other films did.\n\nThe acting was fine in Howling Reborn, I had no problem there. The movie did look a little cheaply made though. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d recommend it to horror fans or not. Most fans of the original Howling films will probably be disappointed in this one. My low rating for this isn&apos;t because it&apos;s a terrible movie, but more because it isn&apos;t a true Howling sequel in my eyes. Therefore it was very disappointing and something that I probably won&apos;t watch again.\n\n3/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4044,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2011-10-18","keywords":"werewolf horror,woman on top,psychotronic film,bare chested male,pregnant woman","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Howling: Reborn","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1135584537","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTFlMzM1ZGYtY2E4OC00YjdjLWIwNzAtNDZmMjE3Y2Q5OWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTFlMzM1ZGYtY2E4OC00YjdjLWIwNzAtNDZmMjE3Y2Q5OWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1135584537/","description":"Trailer for The Howling: Reborn","duration":"PT2M17S","uploadDate":"2012-07-12T03:46:06Z"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2334994/","name":"Landon Liboiron"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1589316/","name":"Lindsey Shaw"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0587431/","name":"Ivana Milicevic"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0632404/","name":"Joe Nimziki"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0249289/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0023327/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0006259/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0104707/","name":"Gary Brandner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0426505/","name":"James Robert Johnston"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0632404/","name":"Joe Nimziki"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}]

It was fun to see local landmarks including Buffalo Billiards, Threadgill&apos;s, the campus and the Governor&apos;s mansion, but how could Tommy Lee Jones go to Threadgill&apos;s and leave without eating one deep-fried dill pickle??\n\nI made a unofficial poll of the women that I know who are over 40 years of age, and every single one said , &quot; I LOVE Tommy Lee Jones!&quot; If that is part of his demographic, this movie should do really well, with TLJ delivering zingers in that cowboy voice, admitting to his 55+ years, and keeping his smiles for the womanly Anne Archer while wrangling the herd of young cheerleaders. \n\nThe supporting cast was also fun to watch - just remember this is not a film - it&apos;s a MOVIE!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25667,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2005-02-25","keywords":"middle age romance,gender in title,four word title,fbi federal bureau of investigation,cleavage","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Man of the House","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi261423385","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA4ZmU5MjAtMDFhMy00ZTkxLTg1OTAtMDMxYWU5YzI5NTk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA4ZmU5MjAtMDFhMy00ZTkxLTg1OTAtMDMxYWU5YzI5NTk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi261423385/","description":"Trailer 1","duration":"PT2M26S","uploadDate":"2008-04-11T14:56:50Z"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0587396/","name":"Christina Milian"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0307726/","name":"Kelli Garner"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0378893/","name":"Stephen Herek"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0003580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0090310/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0572352/","name":"John J.

GB is much less grounded in reality and more absurdist slapstick than ND, which imho makes it more accessible to a general audience.\n\nI like the characters, the actors, and the story, but some of the characters lean a little too hard into their stereotypes to where they lose some believability, and the believability of the characters was a strength of Napoleon. Great cast, sets &amp; props, music, cinematography, lighting, etc.\n\nSaying &apos;Gentlemen Broncos&apos; was &quot;ahead of its time&quot; implies it does something profound, which it doesn&apos;t; but it was ahead of its time in the sense that if it came out today it would probably receive more praise than it did in 2009.\n\nAs a fan of Breen, Wiseau, DeCoteau, Nguyen, MST3K, Rifftrax, EFAP, etc, I appreciate the bad films.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13261,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Fantasy","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-05-27","keywords":"small town,sexual harassment,struggling parent,sexual innuendo,absurdism","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Gentlemen Broncos","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi438632985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjUyMjM0MjEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjUyMjM0MjEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi438632985/","description":"Soon after his latest work is published, science-fiction author Ronald Chevalier (Clement) faces charges of plagiarism from aspiring teenage writer Benjamin Purvis (Angarano).

But they can&apos;t, sadly.\n\nHowever, they all have their place, and some of the better ones in recent memory (Just Like Heaven; So I Married an Axe Murderer; Addicted to Love) all have one thing in common: memorable characters put into memorable situations.\n\nThe Best Man/Unhitched does, but it isn&apos;t Stuart Townsend, who does a decent job of things as the leading man (and girls, he&apos;s just as cute but at least somewhat vulnerable unlike LeStat in Queen of the Damned). It isn&apos;t Amy Smart, who does a decent job of things as the leading lady (and fellas, she&apos;s every bit as cute as we remember her in Road Trip, and gets more screen time, thank the gods).\n\nSo who is it? Seth Green of course. And this little fella doesn&apos;t get my vote simply because I&apos;m 5&apos;5&quot; like he is (give or take an inch or two). Instead it&apos;s because: his accent is really rather good; his character is fun and unpredictable; and we&apos;d ALL be rooting for him or doing what he does in the movie, if our best mate needed our &quot;help&quot;.\n\nSo is the script decent? Not bad. At times it doesn&apos;t flow, and the first half of the movie the dialogue and situations seem a little forced. But there IS an honesty in it, almost as though this or at least part of the premise has happened to the writers or someone they know. The second half of the movie is far better and moves along nicely.\n\nThe acting? Not bad. Everyone except Seth Green just does what is required of them and not much more. The Seth-meister (and I feel like I can call him that) is far more animated and approachable than his turns as Oz in Buffy, or in films like Rat Race and The Italian Job.\n\nCan we believe the romance and the motivation behind Olly&apos;s (Townsend) actions? Somewhat.

I actually think it is a shame, that his first fime as a self-director hasn&apos;t been shown on television, DVD, VHS and not even streaming (not yet at least).\n\nThe film tells a story about a manufactors (Ib Sch\u00f8nberg) daughter, the beautiful and sweet Helga (Birgitte Reimer), who is doing a bet with her friends. She either needs to work a year as a housekeeper without help from anyone, or she owes her boyfriend, J\u00f8rgen (Henrik Wiehe), a diamond ring, and right there, she&apos;ll show J\u00f8rgen, that she can stand on her own two feet.\n\nBirgitte Reimer is known for many movies with Dirch Passer and Kjeld Petersen (Kellerdirk), in &quot;Solstik&quot; (1953) and &quot;Vi er allesammen tossede&quot; (1959). But it&apos;s the fewest so far, who has seen Birgitte Reimer in a sweet, charming and friendly role in one film, and that&apos;s her role as Helga in &quot;Vi som g\u00e5r k\u00f8kkenvejen&quot;.\n\nThe time I write this review (April 2023), &quot;Vi som g\u00e5r k\u00f8kkenvejen&quot; has not been released in public streaming services yet. But fortunately, Nordisk Film is trying their hardest to get &quot;Vi som g\u00e5r k\u00f8kkenvejen&quot; on their streaming service, and will hopefully be released at the end of 2023. But other than 2023, it could also be earliest released 2024, but unfortunately sooner 2027. But the film got released one time in Cinemateket in november 2022, which is where I saw it, and the film was absolutely fantastic.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1953-02-02","keywords":"based on novel,based on play","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0717815/","name":"Birgitte Reimer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0778270/","name":"Ib Sch\u00f8nberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0825452/","name":"Ellen Margrethe Stein"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0050853/","name":"Erik Balling"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0060132/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0095313/","name":"Sigrid Boo"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}]

Opening with a naked man masturbating and being guided through the motions by the disembodied voice of &apos;the director&apos;, this turns out to be something of a red-herring, though it does establish that the film&apos;s central character is a director, (Almodovar?), and that he is gay. What follows is a teasing Hitchcockain menage-a-trois murder yarn, (not mystery), in which the homosexuality of the protagonists is very much to the fore and is hardly seen as &apos;an issue&apos;, (a major breakthrough in what was a mainstream Spanish movie of its day). Indeed &quot;Law of Desire&quot; was the film which really established Almodovar internationally and while gay-themed movies were finally making their mark in 1987 few were quite as explicitly erotic or as pleasurably in-your-face as this.\n\nIts cast was largely made up of what only be described as players from Almodovar&apos;s stock company and in a fine cast Antonio Banderas and Carmen Maura are the stand-outs; he as a pathologically disturbed &apos;fan&apos; whose obsession with Eusebio Puncela&apos;s director leads to murder and she as the director&apos;s transsexual &apos;sister&apos;, a deliriously giddy performance and yet played mostly &apos;straight&apos; by Maura.\n\nIf not quite as deep as Almodovar&apos;s later movies there is nevertheless much to enjoy here, (and although dealing with tragic issues Almodovar teases out the black comedy for all its worth). Now, of course, a great deal of the fun is in slotting the film into the Almodovar canon and seeing exactly where it fits in relation to the movies that followed it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14528,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"NC-17","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1987-03-05","keywords":"male full frontal nudity,gay,male frontal nudity,masturbation,male nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi384746265","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODRhMTY0ZTctOTQ0OS00MWI3LWFjNWYtNDc4MmE4YzI0MjEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODRhMTY0ZTctOTQ0OS00MWI3LWFjNWYtNDc4MmE4YzI0MjEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi384746265/","description":"A gay filmmaker becomes involved with an obsessive fan while still pining for his absent true love.

The freshness and the imagination of the two protagonists, the way in which it recognised the magic (real magic) of Paris, and the strange parallel worlds it created in which Celine and Julie are both deeply involved and creating, and then acting, their own parts. On re-viewing it more than ten years later though, I was surprised to be a little disappointed. The magic is so thin. Celine and Julie have taken the, very conscious and explicit, decision not to grow up, and as a result, although they are beautiful adults, their world is a child&apos;s world. Their imagination is child-like, in its imagery (sweets, plastic &quot;dinosaur eyes&quot;, rather thin puns), in its chosen surroundings (cases full of dolls), its disasters (a grazed knee), its aims (largely disruption of the concerns of surrounding adults), in its ridiculing of sexuality and its steadfast refusal to admit that fantasy is sometimes, necessarily, dangerous. Without any danger or any desperation, it seemed on second visit a charming but slightly futile game."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6590,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1974-09-18","keywords":"female friend,repeated scene from a different perspective,female nudity,masturbation,surrealism","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1830011673","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU1MTZiNjEtOWMwZC00N2Y3LWI1MGMtMmE0NDRiMGU3MjZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU1MTZiNjEtOWMwZC00N2Y3LWI1MGMtMmE0NDRiMGU3MjZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1830011673/","description":"A mysteriously linked pair of young women find their daily lives preempted by a strange boudoir melodrama that plays itself out in a hallucinatory parallel reality.","duration":"PT1M52S","uploadDate":"2022-01-21T13:55:27.325Z"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0078155/","name":"Juliet Berto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0479628/","name":"Dominique Labourier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0644680/","name":"Bulle Ogier"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0729626/","name":"Jacques Rivette"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0006387/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0020040/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0044473/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0078155/","name":"Juliet Berto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0479628/","name":"Dominique Labourier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0644680/","name":"Bulle Ogier"}],"duration":"PT3H13M"}]

Consequently, people travelling to and from Brooklyn must now carry a passport or visa, declare items of value at the Brooklyn Customs points, and perhaps even converse in Icelandic!\n\nIt is a similar, mind-bending assumption (with hilarious practical implications) that British viewers have to make when watching &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; (a London district near Buckingham Palace, no less).  In the film, much of Pimlico (or &quot;Burgundy&quot; as it is now called) looks like a bomb-site, which it probably was still at that time in the aftermath of World War II.\n\nAs one of the so-called &quot;Ealing comedies&quot;, it ranks alongside other films in this group like &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; and &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; which parody - but in an affectionate way - various aspects of British social life.   Conversation is always very parochial and petty.  At the same time, this film preserves certain other conventions of the time - for example, there really was a restriction on how much money people could take out of Britain which lasted until the 1970s.  In &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot;, people travelling on the underground railway have to declare there currency at the &quot;Burgundy&quot; Customs points.  Above all, Margaret Rutherford stands out as the unworldly history professor with sweeping convictions.  This charming films preserves a way of life which, though long gone, is not forgotten."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5476,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1949-10-26","keywords":"pimlico london,burgundy,state within a state,rationing,drought","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1735376665","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjllNTJiMjQtOWVmOC00NDE4LWJjZWMtNjZhYWJkYTZmNGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjllNTJiMjQtOWVmOC00NDE4LWJjZWMtNjZhYWJkYTZmNGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1735376665/","description":"","duration":"PT2M23S","uploadDate":"2020-01-28T19:43:03.404Z"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0391361/","name":"Stanley Holloway"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912735/","name":"Betty Warren"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0614843/","name":"Barbara Murray"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0180191/","name":"Henry Cornelius"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0040024/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0165021/","name":"T.E.B.

Fortunately, that is exactly what the film makers were going for.  I enjoy this one, though it is apparent by its score that most people don&apos;t.  I just find it funny and I love the cast which includes Ron Pearlman and even Angelica Houston.  Heck, John Carradine even has a small role in it, though his scene is absolutely pointless and adds nothing to the flick.  In fact it is a rather serious scene especially considering the rest of the movie. This one doesn&apos;t look great, kind of like Space Mutiny, but unlike Space Mutiny this one isn&apos;t trying to be serious so the effects can be forgiven. This one has a band of space pirates that go after, you guessed it, ice. They do this at the beginning and get immediately captured and this sets up the rest of the movie.  No work of art, but it is entertaining to me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12092,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"1984-03-16","keywords":"castration,ice,time dilation,conveyor belt,post apocalypse","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Ice Pirates","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1601110041","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2Q4ZGE4ZTEtZTdjNS00YTllLWE0NjktZjVlOGFlZTc0NjBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2Q4ZGE4ZTEtZTdjNS00YTllLWE0NjktZjVlOGFlZTc0NjBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1601110041/","description":"Home Video Trailer from MGM","duration":"PT2M19S","uploadDate":"2008-10-29T03:52:54Z"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001810/","name":"Robert Urich"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002026/","name":"Mary Crosby"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0731426/","name":"Michael D.

When you are in Germany as a horror geek you will always be attracted to the sleeves of DVD&apos;s and Blu Ray&apos;s. But Germany also has a speciality to change names from flicks towards more attractive names, this is called Zombie Wars but in Germany it came out as War Of The Living Dead. Admit, nice title, and that&apos;s the best thing of this stinker.\n\nThe acting isn&apos;t really good, as was the script, zombies capturing humans, really. the zombies really are looking cheap.

The film, based on a novel by Hiroshi Aramata, is a sprawling epic that spans decades and intertwines history, folklore, and supernatural elements. Despite its ambitious narrative and unique blend of genres, &quot;Teito monogatari&quot; falls short in some aspects.\n\nThe cinematography by Shoji Ueda is one of the film&apos;s strongest aspects, capturing the stark contrast between Tokyo&apos;s bustling modernity and its hidden, darker side. The cityscape is beautifully shot, with a haunting atmosphere that permeates the film. The special effects, while dated by today&apos;s standards, are still effective in creating a sense of otherworldly terror.\n\n&quot;Teito monogatari&quot; has had a lasting impact on Japanese cinema, particularly in the horror and supernatural genres. Its exploration of Tokyo&apos;s dark history and urban legends has inspired numerous films and stories, making it a significant cultural artifact. However, the film&apos;s convoluted plot and uneven acting prevent it from achieving true greatness.\n\nIn conclusion, &quot;Teito monogatari&quot; is a fascinating, albeit flawed, exploration of Tokyo&apos;s supernatural underworld. With its intriguing plot, standout performances from its lead actors, and haunting cinematography, the film is worth watching for fans of horror and supernatural cinema. However, be prepared for a complex and, at times, confusing narrative that may leave you searching for answers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":490,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"genre":["Fantasy","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1988-01-30","keywords":"time travel,time slip,time traveler,biopunk,prophecy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tokyo:The Last Megalopolis","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2516451609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTczODE0MDItZGRjMS00MzFhLTg4YTgtYWRhZjQ4MmY5MjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTczODE0MDItZGRjMS00MzFhLTg4YTgtYWRhZjQ4MmY5MjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2516451609/","description":"Trailer","duration":"PT1M40S","uploadDate":"2008-04-11T17:27:35Z"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0441526/","name":"Shintar\u00f4 Katsu"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0793562/","name":"Ky\u00fbsaku Shimada"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7014801/","name":"Mieko Harada"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0423228/","name":"Akio Jiss\u00f4ji"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0050588/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0032929/","name":"Hiroshi Aramata"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0370627/","name":"Kaiz\u00f4 Hayashi"}],"duration":"PT2H15M"}]

Hiding behind the &quot;experimental&quot; film tag (possibly from receiving 20000 euros funding from the experimental film board) only serves to pad out 90% of what should have been on the cutting room floor. Its hard to work out where all the money went as the team apparently also worked for free. How much does it cost to hire a plastic sheep? A nativity scene somewhere in Benidorm has a character missing!\n\nThey would have been better making a film around the gay dancer (Android 3) -the only real talent in this film. A couple of the scenes were quite good but were too far apart. If you like Lars Von Trier films you might like it. I went to a packed &quot;international premiere&quot; at the Berlinale to see this and was happy when it ended. But like LVT films, even though I find them at times tedious, some of the shots at least linger in your head for a day or two after and upon a rose tinted reflection it feels that at least you had some kind of experience watching it: that its own vibe. That is an aspect that also holds true for this film. Unfortunately its not as good as the cover.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":187,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5},"genre":["Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-04-20","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854678/","name":"Manolo Mar\u00edn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6854679/","name":"Mois\u00e9s Richart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2180103/","name":"Marta Bassols"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1968783/","name":"Ion De Sosa"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0504427/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1968783/","name":"Ion De Sosa"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3178229/","name":"Chema Garc\u00eda Ibarra"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2014242/","name":"Jorge Gil Munarriz"}],"duration":"PT1H1M"}]

Was determined not to let my apprehension, as to whether &apos;The 5th Wave&apos; would execute its good concept well (having seen so many potential wastes recently), get the better of me. \n\nIt is a shame that after genuinely wanting to like it, not with the intention to hate it or want to, that &apos;The 5th Wave&apos; was yet another potential waste, executing its good idea very ordinarily. Not one of the worst cases but one of the most infuriating ones, not irredeemably awful but the cons outweigh the pros and the cons are hardly big in size. It is not that it didn&apos;t try, to me it tried too hard, executing its elements underwhelmingly and they just don&apos;t go together.\n\nThere are a few good things. Chloe Grace Moretz gives it everything, a very committed performance and comes off well compared to everything else. In fact, a good deal of the cast are game.\n\nProduction design has some atmosphere and while the effects are variable a few are above so-so, credit is due for not overusing and abusing them that it became a CGI-fest. The start does intrigue.\n\nConversely, the camera work and editing were wanting, being far too drab and hasty-looking rather than dynamic. Other effects are artificial-looking. The direction showed someone not at ease with the material and one finding it difficult to control it. While Moretz and the lead cast are game, the children are inept.\n\nThe dialogue is clunky and excessively cheesy, particularly in the teenage/romantic scenes. It was the story execution that was particularly underwhelming about &apos;The 5th Wave&apos;. There was not enough at stake for the survival/end-of-the-world element to work, it was too predictable, a lot could be seen from a mile away, and urgency and tension were missing. The alien-invasion parts suffered from a lack of thrills, no suspense and less than menacing villains. The teenage/romantic elements are just awkward and bog the film down, placed inappropriately at times too. \n\nOn top of neither element being executed well, they don&apos;t go well together, coming over as a muddled jumble of tones and cobbled together storytelling, with every recycled, fatigued clich\u00e9 imaginable with nothing new done with either. The twists were obvious and didn&apos;t really feel like twists, the big one not excepted. The characters were generally bland with their development at best sketchy. The ending is sheer nonsense and impossible to take seriously. Also have felt that open-ended ones hinting at a follow-up are rather risky in case that falls through, watching &apos;The 5th Wave&apos; did nothing to change my mind on this.\n\nIn conclusion, not awful but there are a lot of issues here. 3/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":119648,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2016-01-22","keywords":"alien attack,based on the novel of the same name,dystopian sci fi,survivor,child soldier","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3726226201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExOTczODM3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyOTA4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExOTczODM3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyOTA4NjE@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3726226201/","description":"Four waves of increasingly deadly attacks have left most of Earth decimated.

If it is one I have seen before, that comment has folds from my life and internal imagination. Every film I have seen builds that imagination in some way. A few are profound and some of those are knowingly so, either me or the film knowing.\n\nI saw this a great many years ago, when visual wisdom was less familiar and it had a great impact on me. At that time, the intellectual economy was fueled by a sort of controlled French angst, formatted for digestibility by young college minds. It really was so. Malick was one in my vicinity who could master a meal made of this without excluding more nourishing things, but that is a different story than the one I want to tell.\n\nI cannot recall the year, perhaps 1966, I saw this at the Orson Welles theater in Cambridge. Since then, I collect the sounds of waves on beaches. I&apos;ve travelled widely and for some reason have a near perfect aural recall of each experience of the watered desert. It is my primary anchor to the forms of nature.\n\nThe shape of this film is an outer world, bleaker than anything Lynch has given us. It is a beast of form: factories that even today amaze me with their power. If this existed in Italy \u2014 which I have no doubt \u2014 then Soviet stuff is beyond my tolerance. Huge threatening forms seem created by gods to swallow color and thereby grow, engulfing everything. Within this we have a sole conscious mind succumbing. We drift, we succumb. The art here is homeopathic: we are given an experience in color that has power not in brilliance but in what is not there, what has already been swallowed. The cinematic vocabulary of form \u2014 three dimensional space \u2014 eating minds denoted by color... it is effective. This is Antonioni&apos;s greatest accomplishment, I believe.\n\nNested in this is an inner cinematic world, an island not yet visited by the diseased lumbering ships that spew clotted filth. It is just starting to be explored by a keen, clean sailing vessel. This is literally an island populated by a Miranda, the young, still vibrant inner self that remains of our on-screen body, the woman we have besieged in the outer film.\n\nBut this inner film is a contrast: color abounds. The forms do not contain, they rest. The colors have subdued and incorporated the forms that flow. In a subconscious way, these informed my life as an architect, first in form and later in more encompassing conceptual form. We have a newly adolescent girl on the beach, experiencing rather than observing. Her own inner form hinted at futures in the same way that the outer film&apos;s colors hinted at rich pasts.\n\nAnd at about 1:22 in, we have those waves. The filmmaker has not only manipulated contrasts in color and form, but in the sound experience as well. At this inner beach, the sound is lush, hyper real. We have a few moments of the fullest life you can experience as we hear the smallish waves encounter the beach. May you enjoy and cherish these curated sounds.\n\nIn most beaches, each wave is shaped not by an encounter with the sand, land, but by an encounter with the preceding, receding wave, newly exhausted by its desires and reseeding a growing desire in the next. It is a water to water rhythm of desire that incidentally involves the form of the beach.\n\nNot here. The waves are gentle enough to speak directly to the beach. We have not stirred the greater urges yet: the girl is young \u2014 as young as I was (being male). The caress of water on sand conveys the soft swallow of coarse sand, pillowing and sucking the water. A soft thump unlike anything else, that can only be evoked in memories as primal as taste: scotch, sex, sea air.\n\nMay you find something like this experience in your encounter with cinema, something to anchor the story you tell yourself about ideal order.\n\n(That same beach is mapped onto a shack, outside to inside and painted red in the later images.)\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":18146,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1965-02-08","keywords":"factory,ship,color in title,extramarital affair,depression","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Red Desert: The Criterion Collection","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi371760409","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWM5ZTU2MGUtM2Q3NC00ZGIxLTk2ZWYtYTJkOTRjMTI3MDcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWM5ZTU2MGUtM2Q3NC00ZGIxLTk2ZWYtYTJkOTRjMTI3MDcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi371760409/","description":"Three Reasons Criterion Trailer for Red Desert","duration":"PT1M24S","uploadDate":"2011-04-26T03:31:28Z"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0900143/","name":"Monica Vitti"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001321/","name":"Richard Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0158026/","name":"Carlo Chionetti"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000774/","name":"Michelangelo Antonioni"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0060071/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0030432/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0061252/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000774/","name":"Michelangelo Antonioni"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0346096/","name":"Tonino Guerra"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1779963/","name":"Bruno Guillaume"}],"duration":"PT1H57M"}]

The Soundtrack (with capitals). I own it and it&apos;s on of the best compilations I have ever heard! Dance, rock, jazz, instrumental... It&apos;s all there.

The movie is about a girl getting adjusted to a rehabilitation center that happens to be called Crystal Lake Treatment Center and there happens to be a killer on the loose.\n\nThe flick is weird because right at the beginning the killer is shown ripping a face off then leaving his trademark infinity symbol drawn on the body which makes him known as the Infinity Killer. Then that&apos;s the last we see of him for almost an hour as the story concentrates on the girls in rehab. The lead gets killed 50 minutes in! It&apos;s almost like one buddy wanted to do a Girl, Interrupted story while the other friend wanted to do a Friday The 13th homage flick. They decided to pool their money together and do one film. However the Friday The 13th friend only had 1/3 of the money so that is how much film he got.\n\nSo for only fifteen minutes you get carnage action with the serial killer wearing a Ronald Reagan mask. The production quality was crap. The camera could never keep focused. A few blurred lines were crossed.

Despite of being a mentally retarded person, Sam has a job working in a local Starbucks coffee store and has got friends with some what equal mental capacity. He&apos;s a sweet, good-natured, and loving father to Lucy that is equally attached to him.\n\nUnfortunately, a sordid twist of fate takes place in their paradise, at Lucy&apos;s 7th birthday a social worker believes that Sam, having the mental capacity of a 7-year-old, can&apos;t raise his child that is outgrowing him. Lucy is taken to a foster care temporarily as her father, along with the help of his mentally challenged friends, tries to find a high-profile attorney that can help him get his child back.\n\nAfter multiple attempts, Sam manages to appoint an attorney (Michelle Pfeiffer) who only takes the job at first as a dare. Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer) is a successful busy lawyer that comes home to a cheating man and a son who hates her, through the movie Sam and Rita develop a friendly relationship which is an eye-opening for Rita to value her family and be more involved in her son&apos;s life. Sam goes through a legal battle to retain custody of Lucy, aided by his mentally challenged friends, his agoraphobic neighbor Annie Cassell (Diana Wiest), and his high profile determined lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer).\n\nThe film is enriched with major cast members that in turn give out one of their best performances in their career life. Most noticeably, Sean Penn who initially visited L.A. Goal, a center in Los Angeles for mentally handicapped persons as groundwork to his role. I was truly impressed with Sean Penn&apos;s performance on the set of I Am Sam and how well he managed his role and his dedication to it as he freely indulged in the character of Sam Dawson. For anyone who has Sean Penn as a favourite actor, it&apos;s a must watch as it is easily his one of many remarkable performance and the stepping stone of his career. As for Michelle Pfeiffer, I wouldn&apos;t expect any other actress to perform the role of Rita Harrison as beautifully good as Michelle did. It&apos;s a perfect fit to her character and she accurately embodied the character of Rita that possesses an exhausted ill-tempered work driven nature. Least but not last, the amazing Dakota Fanning did a remarkable role on the set, and by far one of her best performances as a child.\n\nThe movie is Beatles-themed as we first understand Sam&apos;s character as an impressive Beatles-knowledgeable person despite being retarded. He then names his child Lucy Diamond inspired from the Beatles song &quot;Lucy in the Diamond Sky&quot;. As a matter of fact, Michelle Pfeiffer&apos;s character is named after the song &quot;Lovely Rita&quot; by the Beatles and her surname is that of a Beatles member, George Harrison and if you noticed in the film, Rita Harrison(Michelle Pfeiffer) points that George Harrison was her favourite Beatle. In addition, the background music mainly consists of Beatles music and other Beatles songs covered by various artists for certain rights. \n\nThe film is sweeping in its beauty, director Jessie Nelson did a great job in portraying her idea of &quot;I Am Sam&quot; into an absolutely wonderful movie especially after a 7 years of film directing drought. The cinematography is mostly hand-held work as the Camera is always close by to Sam for the obvious reason of picturing Sam&apos;s movement in a subjective sense allowing the viewer to actually feel with the character and pensively translate his actions. It&apos;s a closer look to the mentally handicapped people&apos;s world, that every act of their doing has an essence and that they are truly remarkable in their own &quot;special&quot; way.\n\nLastly, should a intellectual deficiency restrain one from raising his own child? We&apos;ve all had a grandma or grandma that despite of their intelligence in life aspects, had difficulty in helping their kids with their Geometry homework but does that alone hinder the child from having a well educated natural life? The movie has a great message, that when it comes to parenting, love is the most important thing and if that is present then it most certainly paves the way to a healthy parent-child relationship.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":157178,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-01-25","keywords":"child custody,single father,custody battle,foster parent,father daughter relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"I Am Sam","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1653980697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjk5OTkyYWQtY2Q4MC00YWYxLWIwMjYtMmViZTQ4YTM0ZjAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjk5OTkyYWQtY2Q4MC00YWYxLWIwMjYtMmViZTQ4YTM0ZjAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1653980697/","description":"Official Trailer","duration":"PT2M20S","uploadDate":"2020-03-21T17:03:16.778Z"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000576/","name":"Sean Penn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000201/","name":"Michelle Pfeiffer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0266824/","name":"Dakota Fanning"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0625458/","name":"Jessie Nelson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0028247/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0014925/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0425581/","name":"Kristine Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0625458/","name":"Jessie Nelson"}],"duration":"PT2H12M"}]

Some of our fellow IMDb&apos;ers simply don&apos;t have a sense of humor. Note previous reviews were so many haughtily sniff about how &quot;bad&quot; this movie is. Well, of course it&apos;s bad! But this film brings the old Mae West line to life... when it&apos;s bad, it is just so, so good.\n\nI was really impressed this Indonesian effort (not &quot;India,&quot; as too many IMDb&apos;ers had it) spent the effort and resources that are inconsistent with such outright B-movies. Probably some of it was stock footage, but we&apos;ve got explosions, car chases and crashes, helicopters, and pure, non-stop action. In addition, the production deserves credit for rounding up the Caucasian actors in an effort to cater to the American market... since the actors were probably speaking the native language in the Indonesian version (there was obviously an English version, albeit still dubbed), I&apos;d guess the call went out to the round eyes who happened to be living in the country. Sure, the plastic pretty boy hero would give Hollywood a run for its unimaginative casting money (where even today&apos;s character actors have to look superficially beautiful), but I appreciated the &quot;Lady Terminator,&quot; Barbara Anne Constable, very much. Not only did she have the right curves, but she put her heart into the kick-ass role. She certainly lived up to the name of one of the titles of the film, &quot;Nasty Hunter,&quot; by targeting the most sensitive part of the male anatomy. I also liked the totally one-dimensional character of &quot;Snake,&quot; the prototypical stoned surfer dude.

Dr. Talbott is a scientist who is trying to find a serum to counter aging and is willing to sacrifice his wife in order to find the answer. \n\nThe performances by Gray and Terry are solid, as is Gloria Talbott who plays Dr. Talbott&apos;s assistant and Grant Williams, Dr. Talbott&apos;s lawyer and Gloria&apos;s boyfriend who falls under the spell of &quot;The Leech Woman&quot;. Estelle Hemsley is also good as an old African woman who looks like a human prune and offers to show the good doctor the secret to turn back the effects of aging, for a very steep price, of course. \n\nI thought the make up of the Leech Woman was very affective, pretty scary stuff for it&apos;s day.

So that at least works in favor of the movie...\n\nOr so you would think. Alas, but no, that was not the case. Why? Well, because this movie was incredibly slow paced and with very little of any interest or any consequential worth, so it just felt like time stood almost still while a whole lot of nothing transpired on the screen.\n\nI am rating &quot;Nekromantik 2&quot; 3 out of 10 stars, whereas I rated the prequel 2 out of 10. The reason for a slightly higher rating for this sequel was because they upped their game significantly in terms of production and effects. This actually felt like a movie, whereas the first one was more amateurish and like a home movie recorded on tape.\n\nThe storyline in &quot;Nekromantik 2&quot; was quite simple, and very similar to the storyline in the first movie. Just as shame that it was so pointless, because there was very little entertainment in the movie, truth be told.\n\nSure, &quot;Nekromantik 2&quot; also has some fairly gross and bizarre things in it, much like the first movie. It is also visual, but not on the same lewd level as the first movie. The sequel was a bit more refined - if one can use such a word about a movie such as this.\n\nThe acting in the movie was adequate, taking into consideration the kind of movie that you are watching. But don&apos;t go placing any wagers on this being phenomenal acting that will be remembered for years to come.\n\nI watched &quot;Nekromantik 2&quot; solely because I just watched part one and I had both movies lined up.

There is such a sadistic vent to this that it has kept me thinking for days. This is obviously a retelling of the Richard Speck story where a psychotic ex-Vietnam vet terrorizes and kills a group of nurses in a residential house in Northern Ireland. The movie is pretty well done in that it gets us involved with the women and with their assailant. They are real people with prospects; one is even pregnant. I think that&apos;s why this so affected me because when you see those teenage slasher movies you say to yourself that no one could be so stupid. The violence is amplified and unrealistic. This one is so close to home. The business of why people don&apos;t defend themselves is an issue, but when you see the connection to terror and to humanity, you see why this could happen. Still, I could never watch this again and I&apos;m not sure it needed telling.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1046,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama","Horror","Thriller"],"keywords":"forced to strip,forced lesbianism,sexual humiliation,nipples,forced sexual contact","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Naked Massacre: Where&apos;s Amy?","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1238418457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJhOWNhYWEtMzNmNS00NjRmLWJhZjYtOWQyZWE1NWIwZDQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJhOWNhYWEtMzNmNS00NjRmLWJhZjYtOWQyZWE1NWIwZDQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1238418457/","description":"Naked Massacre: Where&apos;s Amy?","duration":"PT1M59S","uploadDate":"2023-03-01T20:22:18.321Z"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0140649/","name":"Mathieu Carri\u00e8re"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0074155/","name":"Debra Berger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0092381/","name":"Christine Boisson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0405759/","name":"Denis H\u00e9roux"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0902839/","name":"G\u00e9za von Radv\u00e1nyi"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0060193/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0076486/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0079247/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6286901/","name":"F.G.

I was the only bloke on my own.\n\nNow, many enjoy a romantic film; generally, I don&apos;t. Audrey Tautou was definitely the selling point for me. I&apos;m sure a good number will find Delicacy a delightful film, full of life&apos;s quirks and nicely Gallic, too.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the scenes are in and around the workplace, the direction is boring and the camera-work often rather lazy. And, the film is getting on for being seriously long - 108mins for a rom-com is pushing it a bit.\n\nThankfully, the characters are rather more interesting with our lovely Tautou generally rather underplaying her lead role and came across as being slightly disinterested, though this may have been intentional. There are a couple of scenes that she acts masterfully, though and these help keep us interested.\n\nThe scenario goes something like this - Nathalie (Tautau) is distraught when her perfect life partner tragically dies. To distract her grief she throws herself into her work as a middle-manager (a law firm, I think), but still she dwells on her loss. One day, she literally throws herself at balding and rather gangly Swede Markus (Francois Damiens) who understandably, cannot believe his luck. She initially denies that she had any reason do have done that but tentatively, they become closer. Getting others - her friends, parents and workmates to take Markus seriously then becomes the thrust of the film.\n\nIt&apos;s quietly affecting and amusing, certainly not laugh-out-loud and will be too subtle and slightly off-key for those who only really go for blatant and brash U.S rom-coms. Better seen (I&apos;m sure) as a couple and even more so if that couple are &apos;together&apos; Delicacy offers some quirky embellishments to add a touch of magic as well as a story that is slightly different. However, as I have said, much of that was wasted on me but I&apos;m still fairly glad that I saw it but I fear, it will fade from my memory rather fast.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14059,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-12-21","keywords":"loss of husband,grief,bereavement,denial,overcoming grief","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1178837273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMzAyMzUwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQxMDUyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMzAyMzUwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQxMDUyMzE@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1178837273/","description":"Three years after her husband&apos;s passing, a woman in mourning is courted by a work colleague.

Oh, there are a number of matters of content that seem quite similar. Though Kurosawa&apos;s story takes place in sixteenth century Japan and Lucas sets his in space in the future, the basic struggles are the same-the restoration of power to a princess and her clan. Some would compare Toshiro Mifune&apos;s General Rokurota Makabe to Harrison Ford&apos;s Hans Solo in `Star Wars&apos; (1977), though there may be more  commonality shared with Mark Hamill&apos;s Luke Skywalker. And the two peasant farmers, pawns in the turmoil of sixteenth century Japanese civil wars, are easily identified as precursors of the `Star Wars&apos; droids, R2-D2 and C3PO.\n\nHowever, when all is said and done, the comparisons are only superficial. It may be more constructive to note some aspects of humor and character that are utilized in general. Kurosawa has always been willing to develop exaggerated characters. The peasant farmers, with their quick shifts between cowardice, bickering , and thievery are good examples of this. Certainly the first two of these traits were incorporated in the character of C3PO (the mechanical humanoid), but R2-D2 shows none of these characteristics. There is, however, an overall sense of humor that permeates both `The Hidden Fortress&apos; and the `Star Wars&apos; films-as well as a strong sense of nobility in the central characters, Rokurota and Skywalker.\n\nThat said, `The Hidden Fortress&apos; seems to me to have clearly been made by a superior filmmaker. Both are good at telling the story. The `Star Wars&apos; films rely heavily on special effects, to the extent, I think, that these are the central features of the films. `The Hidden Fortress,&apos; while a relatively light weight work for Kurosawa, involves much more subtle character development achieved by means of acting skill revealed through visual composition and unenhanced camera work.\n\nThis was Kurosawa&apos;s first use of Tohoscope, a Japanese widescreen process. And he uses the screen frequently to develop character. Over and over again he uses the wide screen to develop and reveal character. The peasant farmers are certainly more complex than the droids, though they are simplistically exaggerated. Kurosawa chose to explore the situation of these piteous beings, buffeted about in the feudal wars of sixteenth century Japan, in visually reinforced  wide screen long shots in those final scenes on the plains.\n\nThe code of the samurai is central to an understanding of `The Seven Samurai&apos; (1954), `Yojimbo&apos; (1961), and `Sanjuro&apos; (1962), and even `Rashomon&apos; (1954). These are all great films centered around the samurai class in Japan&apos;s past. From the ninth century, samurai warriors followed a strict code of ethical behavior known as `bushido,&apos; which remained orally transmitted for generations. Briefly it is a way of life in which the warrior&apos;s honor and purpose are tied closely to the needs of his master. In this respect, he was to be selfless. His was not to understand or concern himself with politics-only to defend with honor the family or clan he served. For such a man the ideal was to be without fear-to always move forward in his employer&apos;s interest-without fear of death-only fear of dishonor. Toshiro Mifune&apos;s character in `The Hidden Fortress&apos; is a military general, but his devotion to the creed and to his princess can be explained relative to this code. His daring, too, extends from that. So, too, his reputation reflects  that of an accomplished samurai. An especially strong scene in this regard is the duel scene in which Rokurota&apos;s skill and bravery are what are prized and respected by his opponent.\n\nAbove all, The Hidden Fortress remains a great adventure permeated with humor and nobility. While the force in the `Star Wars&apos; sense is never mentioned, it remains a tacit part of  Rokurota&apos;s nobility.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":43331,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1960-10-06","keywords":"japan,greed,samurai,pretending to be mute,betrayal","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001536/","name":"Toshir\u00f4 Mifune"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0879947/","name":"Misa Uehara"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0156928/","name":"Minoru Chiaki"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000041/","name":"Akira Kurosawa"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0002219/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0452878/","name":"Ry\u00fbz\u00f4 Kikushima"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0644823/","name":"Hideo Oguni"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0368074/","name":"Shinobu Hashimoto"}],"duration":"PT2H6M"}]

She owed her celebrity to being a &apos;dancer&apos;. How talented she was is debatable but a very short film from 1898 showing her dancing to &apos;La Valse Brillante&apos; of Chopin reveals a charisma and vitality which could not have failed to attract male admirers. Her list of paramours, one hesitates to use the word &apos;clients&apos;, reads like a &apos;Who&apos;s Who&apos; of the Aristocracy including an heir to the British throne and a Russian Grand Duke. She lost her considerable fortune in casinos however and ended up in one room. She must have been extremely thankful for the fee she received when her memoirs were adapted for film in 1954.\n\nAt the time this was made there could not conceivably have been anyone to play the role other than the dark-eyed, raven-haired force of Nature that was Maria Felix and by all accounts she turned down &apos;The Barefoot Contessa&apos; in order to do it. Although the dubbing of her voice, both speaking and singing, leaves a lot to be desired, she looks utterly ravishing in Marcel Escoffier&apos;s costumes and exudes sensuality from every pore. In fact the Oestrogen practically leaps off the screen. The writers have also gone easy on Otero&apos;s character and have stopped short of showing her to be the opportunistic, manipulative user of men that she undoubtedly was.\n\nCapable director Richard Pottier never allows the pace to slacken and it is shot by Michel Kelber in glorious Eastmancolor. Her leading men alas are all rather bland but mention must be made of one of French cinema&apos;s best and most ubiquitous character actors, Louis Seigner of the Comedie Francaise who plays Otero&apos;s manager. Their scenes together are the best in the film.\n\nAs a biopic it is rather superficial and merely designed to show both La Bella Otero and La Dona Maria in the best possible light.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Drama","Musical"],"datePublished":"1954-11-05","keywords":"world,fictional variety show,belle epoque,paris france,1900s","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0299661/","name":"Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0077977/","name":"Jacques Berthier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0782564/","name":"Louis Seigner"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0693398/","name":"Richard Pottier"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0009003/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0095199/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0139561/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0652800/","name":"Carolina Otero"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0767163/","name":"Marc-Gilbert Sauvajon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0797575/","name":"Jacques Sigurd"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}]

So I sought out CABIRIA and enjoyed it immensely as well."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7243,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"keywords":"italy,family of con artists,middle age crisis,caper crime,skull and bones","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3122643737","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJkNzgzYTYtZDFiOC00ZjJhLWI2MjctOTZhNjMzYWI0ZTY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRpZWdtb25n._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJkNzgzYTYtZDFiOC00ZjJhLWI2MjctOTZhNjMzYWI0ZTY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRpZWdtb25n._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3122643737/","description":"A trio of con-men led by a lonesome swindler must deal with their job and family pressures.","duration":"PT3M17S","uploadDate":"2022-01-29T20:27:14.144Z"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002024/","name":"Broderick Crawford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000865/","name":"Richard Basehart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0556399/","name":"Giulietta Masina"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000019/","name":"Federico Fellini"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0032224/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0005342/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000019/","name":"Federico Fellini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0280919/","name":"Ennio Flaiano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0684083/","name":"Tullio Pinelli"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}]

However, the Ark is in the Ori&apos;s galaxy.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Movie","url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0942903/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"brandon_lee420"},"dateCreated":"2010-04-24","inLanguage":"English","name":"Not as good as I imagined!","reviewBody":"The last ever episode for Stargate SG-1 was one that you could remember forever because it defined the team SG-1 as heroic, stubborn, smart, funny, and, no matter what, they had a solution for everything (a bit like Mcgyver). The last episode was intense, emotional, and sad (Teal&apos;c is older than everyone by 50 years or something), so it seemed like the perfect episode except that they didn&apos;t tell you what happened to the Ori. Your hopes are dashed when you find out that the Ori&apos;s fate is unknown. You do a bit of searching around when you see Stargate: The Ark of Truth. You immediately buy it, hoping that this will answer everything. The film is a great addition to the Stargate franchise because it does contain action, laughs, a weird-kind-of story, and it is way more longer so you get to watch the fun more than forty-three minutes. The team is still looking at the clues at what happened to the Ori but when they find out that they are not dead, they go in search of an artifact called The Ark Of Truth, a device which tell the truth about anything if seen by the eyes. Their goal is exactly that but there are others who are after it. The film re-introduces the Replicators back but are they helping the good side or the bad side. The performances are not very different from what you saw in the series but I have to give two thumbs up to Christopher Judge for his great performance as Teal&apos;c, Ben Browder for his jokes and slight remarks during bad times (never did get to fill Richard Dean Anderson&apos;s shoes though), Morena Baccarin for her villainous role but she did slack at the end, Claudia Black and Michael Shanks along with Amanda Tapping for there integrity and, often, funny jokes. Beau Bridges was great as well! I was a bit disappointed at the ending because it is so un-Stargate like and it didn&apos;t even have a twist but it did leave space for some more Stargate films. I loved the atmosphere in the film as well, especially the part where Teal&apos;c is walking with a wound on his back because that part was really beautiful and the camera angle was perfect. The film should have had an cameo by Richard Dean Anderson because he would have been a relief to see in this film. The film is recommended for anyone who enjoys the series and is compulsory to watch since it tells you what happens to the Ori.\n\nThe film starts off with the SG-1 on the ruined planet Dakara, searching around for The Ark of Truth when the Ori appear out of nowhere. A squad of Ori soldiers led by Tomin, husband of Vala Mal Doran, ask SG-1 to surrender and they do. An prior comes between them and when things get heated, Tomin kills the prior and gains the teams trust. Later.... SG-1 embark into the Ori Galaxy on the ship Odyssey with an International Oversight Committee agent between them monitoring the mission. The agent makes a mistake which puts everyone&apos;s life in danger aboard the ship and also risks the failure of the mission. Will SG-1 overcome the mistake done by the agent and destroy the Ori, or will they perish and let the universe be converted?\n\nThe dialog is slightly better and funnier than season nine and tens. It is in a way more grimmer than ever. The action is obvious and no different from what you see in the series, so to put it straight it sucks. The fight at the end was so messy and weird, you didn&apos;t even know which one was which. The plot is straight forward and contains no twists (damn) but enjoy the film for what it is. The music and soundtrack can never get old, even if you have heard it 212 times and I loved hearing the metallic-sort-of music at the beginning. Epic! If you like this, I also recommend: Firefly (stars Morena Baccarin), Serenity, V, Battlestar Galactica, and Stargate Atlantis. 7.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24320,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-03-11","keywords":"snow adventure,stargate,evil god,wormhole,shared universe","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stargate: The Ark of Truth ","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2360475929","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2MDkzODQzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDUyNzcyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2MDkzODQzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDUyNzcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2360475929/","description":"Trailer for &quot;Stargate: The Ark of Truth.&quot;","duration":"PT1M1S","uploadDate":"2008-03-11T12:17:48Z"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0112871/","name":"Ben Browder"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0850102/","name":"Amanda Tapping"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0431895/","name":"Christopher Judge"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0178338/","name":"Robert C.

But since these are not very clever comics, we have copies of Harpo, Jonathon Winters, Laurel and Hardy, Lucy and so on. There&apos;s nothing original or entertaining here except to watch how strong is the magnetism of the past masters.\n\nWatching Cage flounder is also interesting since there are some who celebrate his talent. I&apos;m coming more and more to appreciate how many different types of actors there are and how widely they differ. Cage as a person always sits nervously in his character. This is no problem if he is cast as a person who sits nervously in himself, and of course this is how he is typed. Sometimes it works, for instance with DePalma&apos;s experimental `Snake Eyes,&apos; the disembodied EMT of `Bring out the Dead,&apos; and the pretty sensitive `Raising Arizona.&apos; But when it fails, it fails spectacularly with Cage staring goofily as in that lottery movie, or with shouting as here.

Once the boy had been found, he was put on a list of 200 children to be deported to Auschwitz, his name being the last; one of the Kapos then replaced his name (and of eleven others) with the Sinto Willy Blum, who was then transported to (and murdered in) Auschwitz in his stead (with his brother). In the film, the boy is saved because his discovery coincides with the self-liberation of the camp. In reality, his rescue was a trade off. One can only guess that this was because of the age difference (Blum was 16), but it&apos;s also possible that Sinti were victimized deliberately since no one represented them. Until the 1990s the half million Romani killed by the Nazis were ignored in schools and films alike. The first film to mention this was the French-Romanian &quot;Train of Life&quot; (1998). More convincing early recreations of the Holocaust can be found in the Polish &quot;Last Stage&quot; (1948), the Czech &quot;Distant Journey&quot; (1949) and the Italian &quot;Kapo&quot; (1960).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":858,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1963-04-10","keywords":"buchenwald concentration camp,child in jeopardy,american,prisoner,auschwitz","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0315116/","name":"Erwin Geschonneck"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000090/","name":"Armin Mueller-Stahl"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0944221/","name":"Krystyn W\u00f3jcik"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0079906/","name":"Frank Beyer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0114459/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0355346/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0032054/","name":"Bruno Apitz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0079906/","name":"Frank Beyer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0386629/","name":"Alfred Hirschmeier"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}]

As Fool attempts to flee, he meets their daughter, Alice. Can Fool and Alice escape?","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Movie","url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105121/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"drownsoda90"},"dateCreated":"2007-07-01","inLanguage":"English","name":"Probably Craven&apos;s strangest movie","reviewBody":"&quot;The People Under The Stairs&quot; is a delightfully oddball horror flick that centers on a young boy nicknamed Fool, who lives in a dilapidating apartment in the inner-city ghetto with his family and dying mother. The greedy landlords of the apartment complex plan on kicking Fool and his family out, so he and a family friend, Leroy (Ving Rhames) hatch a plan to break into the landlords&apos; spooky large house (which was formerly a funeral home) to steal a coin collection supposedly hidden somewhere in there. But they get more than they bargained for when they discover the man and woman living there kidnap young children and lock them inside the cellar. What ensues is a bizarre battle between Fool and the landlords as he tries to save all of the abused, deformed people who have been locked inside all their life.\n\n&quot;The People Under The Stairs&quot; is one wild trip, and I say that because it really truly is. Written and directed by horror legend Wes Craven, I&apos;d have to say that this his strangest film, and I think most would agree. The entire script is quite off-the-wall and very strange, but I admire that quality about it. The story is actually pretty unique, I can confidently say I&apos;ve never seen a film like this before. While the storyline may be a little hard to sink your teeth into, if you set aside logic and just watch the movie for what it is, it is quite a neat little horror movie. For one, it has a surreal atmosphere that adds to its overall quirkiness, and it has a certain effect that I&apos;ve never really experienced before. It&apos;s a bizarre movie to say the least, but I think that might be why I enjoyed it so much. The characters are twisted, and the dark, musky setting in the old house is a perfect place for the story to unfold. Plus there is also some dark comedy to be found here as well. In fact, at times this movie seems like more of a seriously twisted black comedy, but I&apos;d say it&apos;s a cross between both of these genres.\n\nBrandon Adams leads the cast as a thirteen year old boy who is caught up in the battle with the psychotic landlords and is surprisingly good, especially considering his age. A.J. Langer plays Alice, the only child in the house that isn&apos;t neglected and locked away, and is also good. The actors playing the mother/woman and dad/man are excellent in their bizarre and over-the-top roles, and Ving Rhames is decent with what screen time he has. There are some excellent sequences in this movie as well, mostly the chase scenes within the walls and labyrinth of passageways and whatnot inside the house. I&apos;d like to point out the special effects as well which were very well done, as was the makeup on the deformed, former-&quot;children&quot; of the landlords, who looked very disgusting. As for the ending, it is also over-the-top and a bit silly, but the entire movie is, really, so this goes along with the flow of the movie well. The film itself as a whole seems to have some sort of deeper meaning behind all of the psychotic and twisted elements - as for me, I have my ideas of what it may be trying to say, but I think it can be interpreted different ways. But it does seem to be trying to send some sort of message, whatever that may be.\n\nOverall, &quot;The People Under The Stairs&quot; is an immensely entertaining but very bizarre and offbeat little horror flick. It isn&apos;t perfect and it is a little out there, but if you can suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours and enjoy a twisted, almost fairytale-like horror movie, this can be a fun experience. But make sure you don&apos;t take it too literally, because it is a very strange movie. All things considered though, I dug it. 7/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41280,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1991-11-01","keywords":"child abuse,african american protagonist,incest,rottweiler,african american","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The People Under the Stairs","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3849830169","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDVlYmIzN2MtOWE1Yy00ZjA0LWJhYjYtYzIzNjY5YjJhOTc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDVlYmIzN2MtOWE1Yy00ZjA0LWJhYjYtYzIzNjY5YjJhOTc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3849830169/","description":"Official Home Video Trailer","duration":"PT1M9S","uploadDate":"2020-01-11T17:02:54.765Z"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0010781/","name":"Brandon Quintin Adams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0569239/","name":"Everett McGill"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0732133/","name":"Wendy Robie"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000127/","name":"Wes Craven"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0035544/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000127/","name":"Wes Craven"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}]

A big task for the maverick director. For a film like this to be made during the free wheeling seventies had to take some big stones. One must admire Mr. Kubrick for even trying to produce and direct such a complex and expensive film that had all the ear markings of a financial and personal disaster. Not only did Kubrick manage to out do his last epic &quot;2001&quot; but he has created a movie that not only showcases the untapped acting abilities of Ryan O&apos;Neil, but a beautifully lensed film that uses minimal lighting , gorgeous sets, perfect balance, positioning and meticulous timing. I have never seen such a magnificent film such as this one. Every shot and frame plays out like an eighteenth century oil painting.\n\nA young Irish man of lower class has the strangest quirk of luck. After participating in an illegal duel, young Barry is forced to flee from his home village. After being accosted by some gentlemanly highway robbers, Barry winds up cross country and becomes a conscripted soldier. Rising in rank, Barry is sent to fight in the Seven&apos;s Year War. Whilst in battle he watches his friends and fellow soldiers being slaughtered in combat due to poor tactics and leadership. Having enough of this life of hardship and struggle, Barry uses his god given talents to do what he has to do in order to survive and become a man of proper social standing.\n\nI was very impressed with this movie. I&apos;ve put off watching this film until recently. Some have told me how long and boring this movie was. Others have said it was pretty self serving and not worth watching. But after seeing part of it on T.C.M., I just had to find a copy of my own. The film is over three hours in length but they go by very quickly because Barry&apos;s story is so captivating. Kubrick poured his heart and soul into this film. The results are on the screen. He&apos;s clearly a master film maker. His reputation is cemented forever with this movie. Ryan O&apos;Neil impressed the hell out me with his role as Barry Lyndon. He gives the character some dignity and depth that no other actor could have possibly given to the title role.\n\nOverall I would have to give this film one of my highest recommendations. This is one of my top ten films of all time. If people tell you not to watch this masterpiece ignore them. I advise you to get a copy and enjoy.

The Werewolves Are Here! is listed in my trusty The Official Splatter Movie Guide by John McCarty, although its inclusion puzzles me, for it features next to no gore. What it does have are interminable scenes of terrible dialogue, dreadful acting, poor sound quality and the general level of technical ineptitude that I have come to expect from exploitation legend Milligan.\n\nThe godawful story sees a young married couple arrive in England to visit wife Diana&apos;s family, the Mooney&apos;s, who harbour a dreadful secret: they are all werewolves. Even with the worst of films, I try to find some sort of positive, but this one has me beaten: I can&apos;t find anything good to say about it. Not one thing. In fact, so excruciatingly amateurish and incredibly dull is this film that, even if it had buckets of bargain basement blood and guts, I can&apos;t see it being much easier to bear.\n\nI rate The Rats Are Coming! The Werewolves Are Here! a pitiful 1/10, although I wish I could give the film 0/10 for including a repulsive scene of unnecessary animal cruelty, the stabbing and nailing of a live mouse.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":547,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.4},"contentRating":"GP","genre":["Horror"],"keywords":"animal cruelty,animal abuse,actual animal killed,period piece,mouse","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0822685/","name":"Hope Stansbury"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0803900/","name":"Jackie Skarvellis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0172578/","name":"Noel Collins"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0288958/","name":"Andy Milligan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0042506/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0288958/","name":"Andy Milligan"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}]

The film easily tops the second outing of the series, and is right on par with the first - with just the right mixture of new characters and settings vs. the older ones we&apos;ve all grown to love (especially Scrat. I can watch a whole movie with this guy).\n\nThis time around, Manny and Ellie are expecting a baby mammoth, something that leads to unexpected responds from Diego and Sid. When Sid decides to become a parent himself in return, he steals three giant eggs he accidentally bumps into, only to later realize they&apos;re dinosaur eggs that belong to a pretty angry mother. When mother-dinosaur kidnaps Sid, it&apos;s up to Manny and friends to return him home safely. Adventures ensue as they find out that underneath their icy world lives a land filled with enormous and sometimes menacing dinosaurs, one which our friends would need to cross in order to rescue Sid.\n\nIce Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is cute but not insulting, the visuals are stunning and if you forgive the obvious historical loophole (there were no dinosaurs during the Ice Age) you can actually have quite a good time. The dinosaurs add a lot to the plot, and there&apos;s actually a very cool, nice sense of adventure throughout the film, one that was somewhat missing (in my opinion) from the previous installment. All this adds to a fun and thrilling experience - alongside the visuals, jokes and general good atmosphere.\n\nTo sum things up - Ice Age 3 is an above average animated film, that&apos;ll appeal to grown-ups and kids alike. I gave it 9 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":271124,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2009-07-01","keywords":"dinosaur,chipmunk voice,ice age,anachronism,sid character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3380019993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyODMyMDY3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg2MTM0Mg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyODMyMDY3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg2MTM0Mg@@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3380019993/","description":"Manny, Sid, Diego, et al. encounter the dinosaur population who survived extinction in their tropical paradise, which existed below the thick layers of ice ... until now.","duration":"PT2M30S","uploadDate":"2009-03-27T13:30:53Z"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005380/","name":"Ray Romano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000491/","name":"John Leguizamo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001459/","name":"Denis Leary"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0757858/","name":"Carlos Saldanha"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0862211/","name":"Michael Thurmeier"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0179259/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0047265/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0073850/","name":"Michael Berg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0010004/","name":"Peter Ackerman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0718514/","name":"Mike Reiss"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}]

I have seen this cult-classic many times &amp; the film only gets funnier each time I re-watch it. \n\n&apos;Dhamaal&apos; Synopsis: Four good-for-nothing companions &amp; a corrupt cop embark on a journey to find a hidden treasure in Goa. \n\nHeavily inspired by the all-time hit It&apos;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, &apos;Dhamaal&apos; offers genuine laughs &amp; tickles your funny bone all through. The characters &amp; their journey as one, is definitely silly, but the sequences are so hilarious, that you are on the floor laughing! The gags, one after the other, are so funnily written, that its impossible not to laugh. \n\nBunty Rathod&apos;s Screenplay borrows heavily from the above-mentioned film, but it works entirely. A special mention for the crackling dialogue. Indra Kumar&apos;s Direction is good. He deserves kudos for not letting the pace drop at any given time. Cinematography &amp; Editing are fair. Music by Adnan Sami is excellent.\n\n&apos;Dhamaal&apos; works because of its terrific casting. Arshad Warsi, Riteish Deshmukh, Aashish Chaudhary &amp; Jaaved Jaffrey are a riot! Their on-screen chemistry as well as their comic timing, is masterful. Jaffrey, especially, is top-notch. Sanjay Dutt is his usual self. Asrani brings the house down. He&apos;s another topper! Vijay Raaz, Suhasini Mulay, Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Pahwa &amp; The Late/Great Vinay Apte are superb in bit roles. \n\nOn the whole, Wanna laugh-out-loud? Watch &apos;Dhamaal&apos;. Its pure fun!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19231,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2007-09-07","keywords":"child,reckless driving,cigarette smoking,f word,driving off a cliff","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dhamaal trailer","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1417198105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VhMDA2MTMtNTU3Ni00NmE0LTg4ZDUtZWY3ZGY4ZGM1ZGE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VhMDA2MTMtNTU3Ni00NmE0LTg4ZDUtZWY3ZGY4ZGM1ZGE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1417198105/","description":"Four lazy slacker conmen buddies who are jobless, homeless and broke learn about the secret of a hidden treasure from a dying thief and later embark on a race against time to find the mobster&apos;s buried treasure and claim it while being pursued by a determined police inspector who is hellbent to get the treasure all by himself.","duration":"PT2M13S","uploadDate":"2019-02-04T09:47:03.793Z"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004569/","name":"Sanjay Dutt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1299011/","name":"Riteish Deshmukh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0451174/","name":"Arshad Warsi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0409791/","name":"Indra Kumar"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0088377/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1885232/","name":"Paritosh Painter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1022273/","name":"Balvinder Singh Suri"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2366632/","name":"Bunty Rathore"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}]

I mean, some of the exorcism-theme movies I&apos;ve watched is pretty decent if not too ordinary. Too similar with the process and the pace. So, when I see that Deliver Us From Evil has arrived, I too didn&apos;t really put up too much hope. I thought this is just another typical exorcism movie.\n\nYou see, most of the exorcism will always start with the same process. Some devil possessing a child (or someone), (usually) the parents got distracted over the fact and try to find a way to rid the devil. A priest got the information and try to help exorcise the demon. The priest done it successfully (or so he thought) only to find that the demon hasn&apos;t really left the child. The priest then try to find a much more experienced priest to help him and finally able to rid the devil for good, but with the cost of someone&apos;s life. That&apos;s pretty much how all exorcism related movie goes.\n\nBut not with this one. I&apos;m actually pretty hyped up after watching it!!! The acting is great, the pace is good and basically got a different presentation to make this into a not boring &quot;typical-exorcism&quot; movie. It actually makes you yearn for more information, dragging your heighten-interest along the way and keeps up the momentum to finally gave you a shocking horror, straight to your face.\n\nI dare gave it 8/10 for Deliver Us From Evil.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":87714,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2014-07-02","keywords":"demonic possession,reference to the doors,priest,exorcism,lion","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1746054425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTI2NzI4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyODEyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTI2NzI4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyODEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1746054425/","description":"NY police officer Ralph Sarchie joins forces with an unconventional priest schooled in the rituals of exorcism to combat the possessions that are terrorizing their city.\r\n","duration":"PT3M4S","uploadDate":"2014-05-16T11:34:37Z"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0051509/","name":"Eric Bana"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1183149/","name":"Edgar Ram\u00edrez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1601397/","name":"Olivia Munn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0220600/","name":"Scott Derrickson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0010568/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0026281/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0479739/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0220600/","name":"Scott Derrickson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0090199/","name":"Paul Harris Boardman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1767483/","name":"Ralph Sarchie"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}]

The opponents are a band of employees who run a high-class apartment building in the heart of Manhattan, and the pent-house tenant who takes their pensions and savings to the cleaners. But, one caper deserves another, and the employees are on the rebound after the FBI get into the picture. \n\nIt&apos;s all about decorum, money, position, working for a living, trusting others, greed, fraud, getting even and justice. That may not sound like the elements of comedy, but they all add ;to a very good and entertaining movie. Ben Stiller is the lead character.

In fact the one scene in that film that had them together was shoe horned into the film. It had to be because in that one the two were on opposite sides of the law.\n\nNo problem on that score here because in Righteous Kill, Pacino and DeNiro play a pair of veteran police detectives who take the job very seriously indeed. What they&apos;re working on now is as the leads in team that is tracking down a serial killer who likes to leave little poetical epitaphs behind for each victim.\n\nThe plot here is borrowed from Magnum Force, but in that film, Hal Holbrook has recruited a personal death squad from among the young officers of the San Francisco PD. and Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry is trying to solve the case. When these guys do figure it out that it&apos;s a cop doing the killing, it&apos;s one individual however doing it on their own.\n\nThis is not a harmonious team that Lieutenant Brian Dennehy has put together. Carla Gugino is trying to show she&apos;s as tough as the men and a couple of younger detectives, John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg are wanting bad to show up the older Pacino and DeNiro. \n\nRighteous Kill is pure gold when the two acting legends are on the screen together. When the attention is not on them however, the story does drag a bit in spots. In fact the very lack of forensic clues at the crime scenes should have alerted this team as to where to look for the killer. \n\nStill no opportunity to see Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro for the price of one ticket should be missed.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":93259,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-09-12","keywords":"rear entry sex,rape,woman in a men&apos;s room,murder of a priest,washington heights manhattan","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Righteous Kill: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi770113817","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQ5ODg1NDcxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI3NjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQ5ODg1NDcxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI3NjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","url":"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi770113817/","description":"This is the second theatrical trailer for Jon Avnet&apos;s Righteous Kill, starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.","duration":"PT2M30S","uploadDate":"2008-05-30T17:21:06Z"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001303/","name":"Carla Gugino"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000816/","name":"Jon Avnet"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0002572/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0017712/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0209305/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1897957/","name":"Russell Gewirtz"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}]

Much of this movie was bad, badly directed, badly acted and badly scripted.\n\nKimberley (played by Lindsey McKeon from &apos;Saved By The Bell: The New Class&apos; &quot;fame&quot;) put in one of the better, but still poor, performances but often seemed like she was forcing the words. However, she was playing a character that was trying to be seen as someone to detest, which she managed to pull off for a small while so credit for that. Of course, one may think that is due to the script, but no...There is so much useless dialogue and so much\n\nlack of useful dialogue that it&apos;s hard to actually understand what&apos;s going on. At times it seemed like the actors were improvising. It all makes sense eventually, but you do have to look for your answers.\n\nExcept for one thing that is, towards the beginning of the film on their way to the resort, the teens stop off at a service station. After a girlie chat in the bathroom the girls run into a European guy named Christophe (Brad Hawkins). After talking with him for a couple of minutes they invite him along. One question - why?! How many women are there out there who would do that? I&apos;m sure even the girls out there that act like Kimberley does in this film wouldn&apos;t do that. But anyway, I digress a tad.\n\nAnother problem with the film is the way they introduce the characters. Almost all the other characters in the film suddenly just make an appearance and then come back much later. Also the acting abilities of these extra characters (especially a pervy Sheriff) was highly questionable. For the short time that they are on screen though it doesn&apos;t really matter.\n\n The directing for most of &apos;Shredder&apos; was sub-par but, having said that, there were a couple of quite well done ski-chase scenes. They were fast paced and aesthetically good. I must also mention that there were some good scenery shots of the snowy mountains. Huson adopted an MTV-style approach to the direction which was mostly an annoyance. It seemed that there were (towards the beginning) many filler scenes which served no purpose to the script just so punk-pop music could be played on the soundtrack. Whether this is his style I don&apos;t know having not seen his only other film as a director, &apos;Decaf&apos;, and according to it&apos;s IMDb page, no one else has either.\n\n The make-up quality was inconsistent. Sometimes the make-up is quite good, fairly realistic looking and quite gory but othertimes it is extremely fake looking and poorly done. The quality of the make-up generally improves later in the film, so maybe two different guys were doing the effects? Thankfully though, apart from a quick and unfortunately cartoony image at the end no CGI was used.\n\nWhat&apos;s most important is the actual film though and like I mentioned previously, the ending helped salvage it. The first hour of the film is where most of the problems I&apos;ve mentioned can be found. The last twenty minutes on the other hand seemed fairly well thought out. Admittedly there were a few consistency problems and the lack of previous and current interaction between the teenagers and the other characters in the film harmed the quality somewhat but I still have to give some credit where it&apos;s due. If the film had been given an extra 10-15 minutes, or hadn&apos;t used so much filler, it could have been improved. It&apos;s the lack of understanding that begins through the non-development of the characters and ideas that&apos;s the problem. A little more character interaction and some extra dialogue would have made everything much more plausible and coherent. Another thing that shamed the ending was the quick array of plot twists that were tried. None really worked well and unfortunately it made things a little sloppy. There were some good suspense scenes and a few moments that might increase your heart-rate but this film isn&apos;t really scary. Also, despite being a small gore content, most of the killings are either off-screen or a camera turn which flicks back to the finished result.\n\nWill I watch this again? Yes, probably. I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s worth checking out (I definately wouldn&apos;t go out of your way) but there are much worse films out there. At least the last twenty minutes somewhat helped to salvage the film, though not entirely fixing the mess the first hour made the film definately upped it&apos;s rating from me in that time. If you see it and like the sound of it then you should check it out. Think &apos;Friday the 13th&apos; with less of a story and set at a ski-resort and your getting close here. I&apos;d say 5.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2173,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2003-12-16","keywords":"hot tub,masked killer,ski resort,teen slasher,teen horror","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0918334/","name":"Scott Weinger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0571636/","name":"Lindsey McKeon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0917923/","name":"Juleah Weikel"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0403922/","name":"Greg Huson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0403922/","name":"Greg Huson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0137887/","name":"Craig Donald Carlson"}],"duration":"PT1H26M"}]

As it starts Elisabeth, an orphaned girl from Stockholm, arrives to stay with relatives; the vicar, his wife and their young daughter Lotta. On Christmas Eve the keeper of the village store is brutally murdered. Police inspector Christer Wijk is in charge of the investigation. There are plenty of suspects but finding out just who is to blame won&apos;t be easy.\n\nI thought this was an enjoyable mystery. The small town family setting reminded me of Hitchcock&apos;s &apos;Shadow of a Doubt&apos;, even though in that film the identity of the killer isn&apos;t a mystery and the plot feels like it could have been taken from Agatha Christie. There are plenty of suspects and motives that should keep the viewer guessing till the end. I must admit the final reveal came as a surprise to me. The cast is solid; some of the acting may seem a little over theatrical at times, at least to modern audiences but that is hardly a problem. There are a few obvious contrivances... twice Lotta gets into danger while looking for her cat.

It was, as I wrote the other day, some of the best cinematic Zen I know, which in my book is the highest praise. However, inspiration can be a fickle muse as this other film demonstrates. \n\nThe difference between the two films is subtle but vital. It&apos;s not a bad film by any means, it&apos;s in the same vein about coming and going, about being there as you quietly yearn for something else. It has some of the same enveloping nature. \n\nThe first half is pretty good, a woman is torn between her reasonable but boring boyfriend, and a bohemian sculptor she knows. This is layered with love stories of their grandparents, compromised marriage and untimely death. An ancient city is being excavated nearby, as meant to point to the same cycles of life through time, memories as they&apos;re dug up. \n\nIt&apos;s just that when you set nature and mood a certain way, as the filmmaker has here, unusually sparse and quiet, it helps to take care of what you use as dramatic counterpoint. The filmmaker didn&apos;t, so all the stuff about loving, losing and memory as someone dying in the second half come off as particularly loud and constructed, almost in bad taste.\n\nWhich in turn, imbues her lovely sunsets and mountains with a sophomoric sense of importance. Whereas the other film was the quiet rustling of the forest, this is as if someone is trying to pluck each rustling sound from a synthesizer to create nature, artificial."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1010,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2011-09-03","keywords":"title directed by female,village,school,woman,love","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4296129/","name":"T\u00f4ta Komizu"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4109050/","name":"Hako Ohshima"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4464972/","name":"Durian Sukegawa"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0442905/","name":"Naomi Kawase"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0348117/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.imdb.com/company/co0189280/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0051760/","name":"Masako Bando"},{"@type":"Person","url":"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0442905/","name":"Naomi Kawase"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}]
