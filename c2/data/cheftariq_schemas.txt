Apart from the semolina and coconut, I had all the ingredients at home. Bought those two. Today, decided to make it to cheer myself up as I had a horrible morning with huge stress so I decided to cheer myself up. This is a VERY easy cake to make! Really quick. You can do this with children too - just make sure they are nowhere near the boiling sugar syrup. I have, for many years, bought this from Turkish or Greek shops but been horrified at the price! Most places charge \u00a315 per kilo!!! Unbelievably expensive! So I searched on the internet for a recipe that would not be too difficult. I found yours. Only snag, all the weights in cups - and I am from the UK. Luckily, I have some US cups here for baking. But while making it, I weighed up everything and wrote the weights down so next time, it is in metric and quicker and easier for me due to arthritis. Wish I could post a photo but it came out exactly the same as yours AND tasted FANTASTIC! Even though I am being careful with sugar consumption and trying to lose weight, I can definitely eat no more than one or two pieces every 2-3 days. It tastes as good as the shop ones, if not better as the shop ones! Thanks ever so much! Going to look at what other recipes you have.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sister Marika Rebicsek"},"datePublished":"2022-05-23"},{"@type":"Review","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"reviewBody":"I appreciate your comment about using more yogurt if doubling the recipe.

I used 1/4 Cup + 1 Tbsp minced garlic instead of fresh cloves (didn't have any fresh on hand). I also used a \"mandarina\" lemon, which is actually a sour orange, but is just as acidic, not sweet, and has an added subtle orange-citrus note. I also used a neutral refined olive oil, but next time, I'll probably opt for sunflower oil.\r\n\r\nI pan-seared a fresh tuna steak and after cooking completely, flaked it and mixed it into half of the sauce in your recipe. I then poured the sauce/tuna mixture over 4 hardboiled eggs for a breakfast for two. It was absolutely divine! \r\n\r\nWe added only a bit of black pepper to the dish. In hindsight, a little tarragon would have rounded out the flavor profile.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rickerz"},"datePublished":"2023-02-06"}],"recipeCategory":["Basics","Mezze"],"recipeCuisine":["Middle Eastern"],"keywords":"Buffalo Sauce, Garlic, Lebanese","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"198 kcal","carbohydrateContent":"13 g","proteinContent":"2 g","fatContent":"17 g","saturatedFatContent":"13 g","sodiumContent":"1169 mg","fiberContent":"1 g","sugarContent":"1 g","servingSize":"1 serving"},"@id":"https://www.cheftariq.com/recipe/lebanese-garlic-sauce/#recipe","isPartOf":{"@id":"https://www.cheftariq.com/recipe/lebanese-garlic-sauce/#article"},"mainEntityOfPage":"https://www.cheftariq.com/recipe/lebanese-garlic-sauce/"}]}]
